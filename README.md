# Greater Bay Area Movie Theater App - HTML/CSS/JS/Jquery #


## Description

Create a web app that connects to Google Maps, with a search bar that looks specifically for movie theaters in the Bay Area. Use HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and you may also implement databases or other libraries to help you gather the information for these theaters. The information that will be collected and displayed to the user can include, film showtimes, reviews, theater reviews (i.e. customer service, environment, the behavior of other patrons, etc).

You should still write the code for the site, including creating the space for the plugins and you must be able to explain all of your choices for third party software.

Do not publish this site, just use the html index for us to access for review at the end of the cycle.
## Context

Create:
A clean and simple interface with an interactive map.

Create an interactive web app that accesses large databases for your specific website use is a great way to understand the concept of full stack development, since you will definitely need to access the skills on multiple languages and frameworks.



Use frameworks and other libraries.


## Client's Specifications
- [ ] When the site loads up, I want a map to appear and a way where I just enter my zip code or neighborhood then the map automatically transports me to nearby theaters.
- [ ] When I click on a theater location, I just want a theater photo, information, customer rating (for the theater), price rating ($ - $$$$), and a button to click through to current showtimes.
- [ ] Please make sure everything loads for me, thanks!
- [ ] If you use any frameworks or code libraries, please cite them and/or explain how you implemented them in a gitbook, or on your README.

## Stretch Goals
Provide information about new release films, which has become a popular pastime.
Publish site.

- [ ] Bonus: Optimize for Mobile.
